Remarks and to do list.


 * This version is usually more up to date than the arxiv version.

 * Egbert says maybe it is not a good idea to use "\mid" for
   extension, as it is usually used for restriction, which can be
   confusing. Probably change this at some point.

 * Prove iterated-↓ and maybe retract-extension-↓.

 * Improve diagram in construction 12 (retracts of ainjectives).
