Remarks and to do list.


 * This version is usually more up to date than the arxiv version.

 * Egbert says maybe it is not a good idea to use "\mid" for
   extension, as it is usually used for restriction, which can be
   confusing. Probably change this at some point. Not sure. We think
   of \mid as the quotient symbol: f \mid j is f over j or f divided
   by j.

 * Prove iterated-↓ and maybe retract-extension-↓.

 * Improve diagram in construction 12 (retracts of ainjectives).

 * Explain a in more detail (the simple) proof of the first resizing
   construction.

 * Something similar to aflabiness -> ainjectivity is Lemma 2.23 of
   "Localization in homotopy type theory" by Christensen, Opie, Rijke
   and Scoccola. By the way, it would be probably a good idea to draw
   a diagram for this proof (and some other proofs).

 * Observation by Egbert Rijke at CAS (2nd May 2019): The subuniverse
   of subfinite types is flabby because it is closed. Also the
   subuniverse of types with decidable equality. Another example is
   the subuniverse of injective types in any universe. (Of course also
   the subuniverse of modal types for any modality that contains all
   the propositions.)

 * Item 5 of Section 2.2: do we need to say that that the point is
   specified? Probably. Think about that.
