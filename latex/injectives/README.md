Remarks and to do list.


 * This version is usually more up to date than the arxiv version.

 * Egbert says maybe it is not a good idea to use "\mid" for
   extension, as it is usually used for restriction, which can be
   confusing. Probably change this at some point.

 * Prove iterated-↓ and maybe retract-extension-↓.

 * Improve diagram in construction 12 (retracts of ainjectives).

 * Explain a in more detail (the simple) proof of the first resizing
   construction.

 * Something similar to aflabiness -> ainjectivity is Lemma 2.23 of
   "Localization in homotopy type theory" by Christensen, Opie, Rijke
   and Scoccola. By the way, it would be probably a good idea to draw
   a diagram for this proof (and some other proofs).
